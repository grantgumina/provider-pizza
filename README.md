# provider-template

`provider-template` is a minimal [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider
that is meant to be used as a template for implementing new Providers. It comes
with the following features that are meant to be refactored:

- A `ProviderConfig` type that only points to a credentials `Secret`.
- A `MyType` resource type that serves as an example managed resource.
- A managed resource controller that reconciles `MyType` objects and simply
  prints their configuration in its `Observe` method.

## Developing

Run against a Kubernetes cluster:

```console
make run
```

Install `latest` into Kubernetes cluster where Crossplane is installed:

```console
make install
```

Install local build into [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
cluster where Crossplane is installed:

```console
make install-local
```

Build, push, and install:

```console
make all
```

Build image:

```console

```

Push image:
